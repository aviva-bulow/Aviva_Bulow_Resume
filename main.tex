%   Professional Summary 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\header{Professional Summary}
A software engineer with 6 years experience (primarily back-end systems in Python), I'm currently learning front-end development (in JavaScript/HTML with React+Bootstrap).

As an analytical thinker with a background in mathematics, I enjoy tackling difficult problems and exploring new ideas. What's more, I'm highly effective at communicating complex concepts across knowledge barriers.
